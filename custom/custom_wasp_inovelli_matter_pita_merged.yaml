    ## WASP Inovelli Matter Switch With PITA
    
    A comprehensive automation blueprint combining:
    - **Inovelli Matter Switch Tap Sequences**: Handle tap events from Inovelli Matter switches
    - **WIAB+ (Wasp in the Box Plus)**: Occupancy detection using door and motion sensors
    - **Input Boolean Toggle Actions**: Execute actions based on occupancy helper state changes
    - **PITA (Persistent Interruptible Timer Automation)**: Resilient timer handling that survives HA restarts
    
    ### Key Features
    - Respond to Inovelli switch Up/Down/Config button taps and holds
    - Detect room occupancy using door sensors and motion sensors ("Wasp in a Box" concept)
    - Trigger custom actions when occupancy state changes (on/off)
    - Persistent timer that fires missed events after HA restarts
    
    ### Requirements
    - Inovelli Matter Switch (VTM30-SN, VTM31-SN, VTM35-SN, VTM36)
    - Door sensor(s) and motion sensor(s)
    - Input boolean helper for occupancy tracking
    - Timer helper with `restore: true` enabled
    - Input datetime helper for timer expiration tracking
